= HDL-LIB

A small library of Verilog Modules for FPGA Designs. Intended to including things like communication peripherals (UART/SPI), interconnects, etc. Each folder contains an individual component, which includes the specification/design, the RTL, and the testing/verification.

The modules here are written in SystemVerilog and verified using Verilator and Yosys.
