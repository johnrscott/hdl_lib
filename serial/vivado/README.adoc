= Xilinx Device Tests

This folder contains the sources for use with Vivado for programming Xilinx devices. 

Some notes:

* Vivado does not allow a SystemVerilog top-level module, so the design must be wrapped in a Verilog module.
* Do not use a block design as the top-level module; it does not refresh properly when the RTL changes. Instead, use the RTL verilog wrapper as the top module, and place the clock generator inside this module
** Generate the clock module by creating a block design, adding the clocking wizard, generating output products, and then creating an HDL wrapper.
